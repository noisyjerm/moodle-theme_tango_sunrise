	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Tango sunrise is built from Bricks. It is two columns with the blocks on the right.</p>
        <ul>
           <li>The blocks have associated icons mostly taken from the desktop theme &quot;Tango&quot;.</li>
           <li>The dock titles have been replaced with icons.</li>
           <li>The header is minimal, leaving more room for learning activity</li>
           <li>A configurable &quot;help&quot; popup is included</li>
        </ul>
	<p>Configurable colours will come later, but for now the intention is to have content area colours that are neutral and a header that reflects Moodle.</p>
