Tango Sunrise :: A theme for Moodle 2. 

This is a work-in-progress theme. Help much appreciated

THEME GOALS
-----------

1) Be really good looking
2) Be really useable by
    - having clear layout
    - keep auxiliary info to a minimum and out of the way of the main content
    - include extra features and javascript (ajax) if and where this helps useability (eg log in box)
3) Be colour neutral (header excluded) to allow for easy re-using
4) Acknowledge the Moodle heritage by 
    - using the Moodle orange colour in the header
    - retain Moodle-esque styling such as discrete blocks with header background

CURRENT FEATURES
------------------
Block titles in the dock are replaced with icons taken from the desktop theme Tango.
Other features include:
 - short header to maximise courseware area
     - mimics traditional desktop application with (custom) menu along top bar
 - easy to include Google analytics
     - Not sure if this is worthwhile given it can be included in the additional html settings
     - but could include more options and tidier reporting?
 - help popup
     - needs to be more configurable. E.g. Option to be hidden and option to go to link or show popup
 - login popup
 - good looking ;-)
